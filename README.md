### Project Description
**Udaan** is a learning platform dedicated to empowering women who lack access to basic education and essential skills due to social or personal restrictions. It offers diverse skill-based courses to help women learn, grow, and achieve independence. A built-in safety extension discreetly redirects to shopping websites when activated, ensuring privacy and protection while studying.


### The Problem statement
Many women face social, cultural, or personal restrictions that prevent them from accessing basic education and skill development opportunities. Even when online learning is available, the fear of being monitored or judged can discourage them from pursuing knowledge.

### The Solution
Udaan provides a secure online learning platform where women can acquire essential skills and knowledge safely. With a discreet safety extension that redirects to shopping websites, it ensures privacy, allowing women to learn confidently without fear of exposure.
